"smell is too potent-i smelled this body wash in store and liked the scent. i tried it today and it was pleasant in the shower, not too crazy. after i dried off and started my day, i noticed that the scent was just incredibly disgustingly potent. i tried to tolerate it, hoping it would fade, but the scent was so strong it made me nauseous. i ended up having to take another shower and scrub my body with a different body wash to make the scent go away, and i can still smell it on my skin. even someone walked by the bathroom and complained that the scent of the body wash was too strong. not sure if my batch is off or this is how they normally are, but i won't be using the rest of the bottle or ever purchasing again.","fragrance, product quality, convenience","fragrance strength, personal likability (fragrance), product application, scent longevity, scent tolerance"

"wonderful, masculine body wash!-switched from major commercial brand products, full of synthetic and toxic ingredients, and happy to have found an alternative for my husband's body wash here on grove! very nice scent, but not overpowering, feels clean, and doesn't cause dry skin. been using for months now, still satisfied!","fragrance, skin care, brand value","masculine fragrance, fresh / clean feeling, hydrating / moisturizing, natural ingredients, satisfaction"
"wondering if i used the same body wash.-eh. average, at best. not a great lather...smelled good from the bottle, but that was about it. left no good (or bad) scent on me; which, i like my body wash to be somewhat noticeable after a shower. i think the new men's method line delivers more than harry's. sorry...fail on the body wash, and i'm not a fan of the razors, either.","product texture, fragrance, comparative analysis","lather, fragrance strength, scent retention, brand comparison"
works great. leaves your skin soft and nice smelling and the scent stays with u for most of the day. i will be purchasing it again and will recommend it to friends.

"works great-i use this product at least once a day in the shower. the smell is fantastic - not too strong, but noticeable. the soap creates a nice lather and spreads well over my body. i would certainly purchase this product again.

"works great-oldspice - old spice red zone swagger scent foamer body wash for men, 10.3 oz is a go to from now. my boyfriend loves using it when he comes over, he smells fresh and has a natural cologne like scent for the rest of the day. just be careful not to press too hard on the pressure button or the piece falls off [this review was collected as part of a promotion.]","fragrance, companion approval, product functionality","fresh fragrance, natural scent, product durability, spouse / partner"
would buy again-the best body wash i've found,"re-purchase intention, product quality","best-in-class, re-purchase justification"
would not recommend-the good things are that the ingredients are naturally derived. the bad thing is that the scent doesn't last. better off getting a cheap unscented body wash.,"poor recommendation, product texture, fragrance","natural ingredients, fragrance strength, value justification"
wow last so long the scent-it smells incredible my husband been using he loves that a little goes a long way and smells incredible. other day he was cutting grass outside and yard work came inside to eat and i was in shock how good he still smelled from this bodywash not only lasted all day but even while he sweat and worked .

"you might just fall in love with it!! i know i did!-the hydrating body and face wash contains ginseng and orange peel extract. these are both ingredients that i use in my current face mask, as it prevents irritations and skin tightening. just like it says on the packaging - ""endurance"" - i went out to play a game of soccer and even after that, the fresh scent still ingered on, and it made me feel energized and revitalized even after a tiring game.","fragrance, skin care, product texture","fresh fragrance, hydrating / moisturizing, long lasting fragrance, personal likability (fragrance), skin benefits, sports / fitness"
