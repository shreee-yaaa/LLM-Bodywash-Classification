Soon after I found myself bereft of the things that smelled of home. While I don't mind diesel soot and overflowing garbage at times, I do long for those old familiar scents. I'd also began to miss the rural activities. I had no lawn to cut, no garage to tinker in, no more camouflage. Fast forward a decade or two and I stumble upon this bottle of manly goodness. Upon the cracking of the ergonomically designed pop/top lid I quickly discovered that I no longer had to smell of Chad or Brock with Axe, Roy or Bill with Dial, Grayson or Skylar with Dove. No, I could now smell pleasantly obnoxious. Manly obnoxious. My glaring nostrils over-inhaled scents of 2 cycle exhaust, WD-40, and the fresh mailing of a pine through a wood chipper. When washing, I feel like angelic duct tape has wrapped my slightly major finger injury in warmth and comfort of lesser gods. After two weeks my chest hair has returned, I've rediscovered the Army surplus store, and currently pricing rural tracts of land contains abandoned vehicles and reeking of deer urine. My briefcase now a rucksack and my Kia has become a Ranchero. Thank Cremo, you've helped me become the man I once was. Godspeed.\"\n",
